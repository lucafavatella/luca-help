The specification commonly used for [network booting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_booting) is [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment), based on DHCP and TFTP.

The PXE client is usually found in the BIOS/NIC/UEFI.

An open-source PXE client is iPXE, another is U-Boot.
coreboot [can](http://www.coreboot.org/Payloads) boot a PXE client.
